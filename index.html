        <p>
          The article element identifies a self-contained piece of content which
          could theoretically be distributed to other websites and platforms as
          a stand-alone unit. The article element is a good choice to contain
          entire blog posts, news articles, and similar content.

          <p>
            Section elements are used to define sections in a document. A
            section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content,
            typically with a heading. Each section should be identified,
            typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the
            section element.

          <p>What is a sectioning element?</p>
          <p>
            The HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a
            document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to
            represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few
            exceptions. Oct 13, 2023
