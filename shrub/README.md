# Grading Criteria

When you submit your assignment, other learners in the course will review and grade your work. They will be looking for the following:

Visual layout

When viewing the home page in the browser:

Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?

Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?

Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?

Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?

Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

Semantic structure

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

A header element for the logo?

A nav element for the navigation menu?

A main element for the content?

A footer element for the footer?

Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?

CSS layout, styling and effects

When opening the CSS file in VS code, ask yourself the following:

Is it a grid or flexbox layout?

Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?

What works well?

What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?

You'll also need to give feedback on and grade the assignments of two other learners using the same criteria.
